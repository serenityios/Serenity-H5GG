# Serenity H5GG Plugin

Serenity's H5GG Plugin helping Non-Jailbroken Users make a Good H5GG Script/HTML

## Installation 

In the Packages Folder, you can find the .dylib of the H5GG Plugin and you will have to inject this into the .app folder.

There are 2 other files one called "H5GG.deb" which injects H5GG and the plugin straight into the .app

And there is one called "Playground.deb" that injects the H5Gg Plugin and a Playground Menu .dylib with every feature to test

I would recommend you use the H5GG.deb in the Packages directory, because when you inject it using example ESign both H5GG and the plugin injects, then you can use MakeTweak to make the H5GG .dylib and reinject with the new Made .dylib and the .dylib plugin.

My english is bad, you will probably figure out what i mean

## Usage

The Usage is in the "Usage" Folder.

## Features

- Custom Alert
  
  Unlike H5GG's Default Custom Alert,    it now lets Users add a custom Alert
  Title & Description.

- Auto Click
  
  Using the [PTFakeTouch Library](https://github.com/Ret70/PTFakeTouch),
  We implemented Autoclicking for Non-   Jailbroken Users.

  This can be fully controlled by JS
  And a Draggable Circle for the User.

- Hooking

  With Help From [Little 34306's JailedHookNoOrig Repository](https://github.com/34306/JailedHookNoOrig) We managed to make a JS Function for H5GG that allows up to 6 Hooks without swapping the Binary file

  It is based on Ellekit & iSH as the
  repository says.

  We also allow unhooking, since the 6
  Hooks Limit is kind of strict.

- Memory Editing
 
    With JS you can Memory Edit (H5GG      Does this, this is kind lf useless)

   it also has a custom objective c    menu you can open for the memory      editing.
